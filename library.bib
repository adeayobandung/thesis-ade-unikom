abstract = {The inventory machine is a device for managing the use of goods. In order to achieve the high efficiency and accuracy of data collection, processing and transmission of goods on site, a system of inventory machine based on barcode scanning technology is designed and developed. The system uses Java as programming language and designs a reasonable barcode scanning recognition mechanism. The external interference factors affecting barcode recognition and the problem that dirty barcode cannot be recognized are studied. Digital image processing technology is added to the inventory machine system, which improves the scanning speed of the inventory machine and the correct rate of barcode recognition. Through on-site testing, the system being developed meets the requirements of the enterprise for the inventory machine, and can complete the inventory and settlement of goods information efficiently and accurately in a fixed time. Compared with the previous use of the inventory machine, the cost and manpower cost in barcode scanning time are greatly reduced.},

We need the best student to participate in a competition held by the Indonesia Security Incident Response Team on Internet Infrastructure (ID SIRTII) of the Ministry of Communication and Information. This process uses Weka software to calculate the best student. It provides the various method to explore the data. One of them is clustering method. There are many algorithms in clustering method. In this research, we will investigate widely about one of that algorithms. Its name is K-Means. This algorithm (K-Means) will give the recommendations about the best student based on the cluster. It will represent the many clusters of a student group. The best cluster can be calculated more to get the names of the best students group. They are eligible to enter the competition. K-means involve the GPA (Grade Point Average) and related course to support the academic skill in order to get the best student. This research helps the teacher select the best student to enter the competition. Many similar cases can use this algorithm in order to get the best student.},

abstract = {Monitoring and control of the output yield of steel in a steelmaking shop plays a critical role in steel industry. The yield of steel determines how much percentage of hot metal, scrap, and iron ore are being converted into steel ingots. It represents the operational efficiency of the steelmaking shop and is considered as an important performance measure for producing a specific quantity of steel. Due to complexity of the steelmaking process and nonlinear relationship between the process parameters, modeling the input-output process parameters and accurately predicting the output yield in the steelmaking shop is very difficult and has been a major research issue. Statistical models and artificial neural networks (ANN) have been extensively studied by researchers and practitioners to model a variety of complex processes. In the present study, we consider random forests (RF), ANN, dynamic evolving neuro-fuzzy inference system (DENFIS) and support vector regression (SVR) as competitive learning tools to verify the suitability of applications of these approaches and investigate their comparative predictive ability. In the present investigation, 0.00001 of MSE is set as a goal of learning during modeling. Based on real-life data, the computational results depict that the training and testing MSE values of SVR and DENFIS are close to 0.00001 indicating that they have higher prediction ability than ANN and RF. Also, mean absolute percentage prediction errors of the proposed models confirm that the predicted yield based on each method is in good agreement with the testing datasets. Overall, SVR performs best and DENFIS the next best followed by ANN and RF methods respectively. The results suggest that the prediction precision given by SVR can meet the requirement for the actual production of steel.},

abstract = {The rapid adoption of mobile devices has dramatically changed the access to various networking services and led to the explosion of mobile service traffic. Mobile service traffic classification has been a crucial task that attracts strong interest in mobile network management and security as well as machine learning communities for past decades. However, with more and more adoptions of encryption over mobile services, it brings a lot of challenges about mobile traffic classification. Although classical machine learning approaches can solve many issues that port and payload-based methods cannot solve, it still has some limitations, such as time-consuming, costly handcrafted features, and frequent features update. With the excellent ability of automatic feature learning, Deep Learning (DL) undoubtedly becomes a highly desirable approach for mobile services traffic classification, especially encrypted traffic. This survey paper looks at emerging research into the application of DL methods to encrypted traffic classification of mobile services and presents a general framework of DL-based mobile encrypted traffic classification. Moreover, we review most of the recent existing work according to dataset selection, model input design, and model architecture. Furthermore, we propose some noteworthy issues and challenges about DL-based mobile services traffic classification.},

abstract = {Tomato quality is one of the most important factors that helps ensuring a consistent marketing of tomato fruit. As ripeness is the main indicator for tomato quality from customers perspective, the determination of tomato ripeness stages is a basic industrial concern regarding tomato production in order to get high quality product. Automatic ripeness evaluation of tomato is an essential research topic as it may prove benefits in ensuring optimum yield of high quality product, this will increase the income because tomato is one of the most important crops in the world. This article presents an automated multi-class classification approach for tomato ripeness measurement and evaluation via investigating and classifying the different maturity/ripeness stages. The proposed approach uses color features for classifying tomato ripeness stages. The approach proposed in this article uses Principal Components Analysis (PCA) in addition to Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithms for feature extraction and classification, respectively. Experiments have been conducted on a dataset of total 250 images that has been used for both training and testing datasets with 10-fold cross validation. Experimental results showed that the proposed classification approach has obtained ripeness classification accuracy of 90.80{\%}, using one-against-one (OAO) multi-class SVMs algorithm with linear kernel function, ripeness classification accuracy of 84.80{\%} using one-against-all (OAA) multi-class SVMs algorithm with linear kernel function, and ripeness classification accuracy of 84{\%} using LDA algorithm.},

Moreover, its interlinking with the quality management perspective is still very limited. It is worth mentioning here that, in the present competitive world, the dynamics of market does not allow any deviation in quality of end product. Therefore, the importance of quality management is universally espoused by the researchers and practicing managers working in this area. It has been found by the authors that the focused approaches in evaluating quality management issues within inter and intra organization supply chain contexts are indispensable. During review of the open literature available in this area, the authors investigated that in present scenario there are number of quality related issues (either at the suppliers end or at manufacturers end) in supply chain management which needs immediate attention of the researchers. In this context the quality of supply chain itself can provide a path breaking solution at different levels of supply chain management. Moreover, this concept may be applied to address the problems such as product recall, delay in delivery of products etc. regardless of type of industry. In this paper, the authors have reported intensive studies based on the work carried out by various researchers in the area of supply chain management. Further, an attempt has also been made to identify conceptual interlinking between Supply chain management and Quality management through literature review.},

Problems faced in the company that there is no optimal planning in determining the size of ordering of raw materials. Reservations made during this only based on the quantity of raw materials ordered can meet the needs during a certain period without considering the total cost incurred. The main purpose of this research is to determine the policy of controlling raw material requirement for the coming period by paying attention to the inventory cost incurred. In this research used lot sizing technique based on Silver Meal algorithm and Wagner Within algorithm. The use of lot sizing technique based on Wagner Within algorithm resulted in a cost efficiency of 3.6{\%} for klabang material while Silver Meal of 2.9{\%} for semi-polished rattan and 3.4{\%} for leles compared to the lot sizing technique applied by the company.},

Objectives of this    study was to  analy   sis  farmers' behavior in coping with risks and risks management strategy on red pepper farm management on lowland in Central Java. This study was carried out    between  February to March, 2009, in lowland areas in Kersana sub district, Brebes district; Karangnongko, Jogonalan, Manisrenggo, and Ngawen sub districts, Klaten district, and Teras sub district, Boyolali district, Central Java.     Decision to adopt dominant cropping pattern by including red pepper as  high economic value commodity  was an ex ante risk management strategy. Meanwhile, interactive risk management was carried out through over use of seeds and pesticides. If the farms failed and led to lower households' incomes and farm sustainability, the farmers tended to employ other farm incomes, to draw savings, to sell some assets, and to borrow as the ex post risk strategy management. Implications of this study are: (i) cropping patterns need to include red pepper to sustain and    to  improve farmers' incomes; (ii) application of hybrid red pepper varieties to cope with environmental pressure and pests' attack; (iii) farm practice technique should be locally specific based on red pepper varieties and agro ecology; (iv) farm diversification and agriculture insurance could lessen production risk; and (v) farmers' group and contract farming will reduce marketing risks.},

This paper proposed an application named Pinjemobil, a web-based application in which vehicle owners can advertise their vehicles for rent. It is expected to maximize the utilization of privately owned vehicles to reduce the growth of vehicle ownership. Moreover, vehicle owners can gain additional income by renting their vehicles. Rapid Application Development (RAD) is utilized, which consists of four phases. Usability testing will be performed after the prototype is completed to measure user satisfaction. The evaluation will examine four usability variables in user satisfaction model, i.e., ease of use, customization, download delay, and content of the interface. It can be concluded that the RAD method can be applied effectively in building the Pinjemobil application due to its flexible nature. The evaluation results have shown that Pinjemobil application has successfully presented a well-received UI/UX with the average percentage of user satisfaction 83.93{\%}.},

This paper identifies and discusses various definitions of supply chain management, summarizes the associated bodies of knowledge and connects them using a systems approach. Systems levels of supply chain management are identified as the internal supply chain, the dyadic relationship, the external supply chain and the inter-business network. Empirical research on behavioural aspects of relationships, chains and networks in the European automotive aftermarket is discussed, identifying gaps in perceptions of requirements and performance held by customers and suppliers in the areas of quality, delivery, service, range and price. A combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis demonstrates substantial differences between approaches to supply chain management, though performance in relationships, chains and networks in the territories examined does not differ significantly. Customer dissatisfaction in relationships is shown to increase upstream in the supply chains examined, extending the applicability of the industrial dynamics 'Forrester effect' to softer, behavioural aspects of performance. Conclusions are drawn supporting the suggestions of operations strategists that position in the supply chain is an important strategic variable which, to date, have not been comprehensively proven empirically. {\textcopyright} 1996 British Academy of Management.},

We believe the existing lack of such clarity on the topic is due to its interdisciplinary nature that involves at its core both behavioral-economic topics as well as artificial intelligence. We dive deeper into the interdisciplinary nature and contribute to the formation of a clear frame of discussion. We review the related works that are about market prediction based on online-text-mining and produce a picture of the generic components that they all have. We, furthermore, compare each system with the rest and identify their main differentiating factors. Our comparative analysis of the systems expands onto the theoretical and technical foundations behind each. This work should help the research community to structure this emerging field and identify the exact aspects which require further research and are of special significance. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Researchers have recently pursued methods for automating the design of spoken dialogue management using machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning. In this paper, we discuss how dialogue management is handled in industry and critically evaluate to what extent current state-of-the-art machine learning methods can be of practical benefit to application developers who are deploying commercial production systems. In examining the strengths and weaknesses of these methods, we highlight what academic researchers need to know about commercial deployment if they are to influence the way industry designs and practices dialogue management. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper reports qualitative observations of learning of object-ori-ented programming in an introductory course. The students were found to cope reasonably well with the object-oriented concepts, and they had learnt procedural programming first. However, they modeled the real world domain to be represented in the program by imagination and through coding. Their problems may be attributed to the high complexity generated by having to relate to four - six areas of attention. Three ways of improving teaching are suggested, making the areas of attention and the ways to relate them more explicit for the students, forcing modeling by means of a tool, and reducing complexity by means of programming environments that visualize objects and their behavior.},

Behavior change is one of the most powerful strategies to prevent osteoporosis. This study aimed to determine the predictive construct of physical preventive behavior of osteoporosis in women aged 30-50 in Khorramabad, west of Iran. This study included 269 women selected from all the health centers of Khorramabad city according to the inclusion criteria of the study and through random cluster and systematic sampling. The data gathering tools were valid and reliable questionnaires of demographic information, stages of change, decisional balance, self-efficacy, and physical activity. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The mean of the subjects' age was 38.72±7.003, and the mean of light weekly physical activity was 38.83±56.400. The results showed that the construct of self-efficacy had the highest predictive power of the preventive behavior. The results also showed that self-efficacy among the constructs of the Trans-theoretical Model was the only predictive construct for osteoporosis prevention behavior. Therefore, the findings of this study can serve as a base for educational interventions in behavioral changes to prevent of osteoporosis by health authorities.},

abstract = {Recent studies of software defect prediction typically produce datasets, methods and frameworks which allow software engineers to focus on development activities in terms of defect-prone code, thereby improving software quality and making better use of resources. Many software defect prediction datasets, methods and frameworks are published disparate and complex, thus a comprehensive picture of the current state of defect prediction research that exists is missing. This literature review aims to identify and analyze the research trends, datasets, methods and frameworks used in software defect prediction research betweeen 2000 and 2013. Based on the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 71 software defect prediction studies published between January 2000 and December 2013 were remained and selected to be investigated further. This literature review has been undertaken as a systematic literature review. Systematic literature review is defined as a process of identifying, assessing, and interpreting all available research evidence with the purpose to provide answers for specific research questions. Analysis of the selected primary studies revealed that current software defect prediction research focuses on five topics and trends: estimation, association, classification, clustering and dataset analysis. The total distribution of defect prediction methods is as follows. 77.46{\%} of the research studies are related to classification methods, 14.08{\%} of the studies focused on estimation methods, and 1.41{\%} of the studies concerned on clustering and association methods. In addition, 64.79{\%} of the research studies used public datasets and 35.21{\%} of the research studies used private datasets. Nineteen different methods have been applied to predict software defects. From the nineteen methods, seven most applied methods in software defect prediction are identified. Researchers proposed some techniques for improving the accuracy of machine learning classifier for software defect prediction by ensembling some machine learning methods, by using boosting algorithm, by adding feature selection and by using parameter optimization for some classifiers. The results of this research also identified three frameworks that are highly cited and therefore influential in the software defect prediction field. They are Menzies et al. Framework, Lessmann et al. Framework, and Song et al. Framework.},

Clusters that contain collateral, identical characteristics in a dataset are grouped using reiterative techniques. As the data in real world is growing day by day so very large datasets with little or no background knowledge can be identified into interesting patterns with clustering. So, in this paper the two most popular clustering algorithms K-Means and K-Medoids are evaluated on dataset transaction10k of KEEL. The input to these algorithms are randomly distributed data points and based on their similarity clusters has been generated. The comparison results show that time taken in cluster head selection and space complexity of overlapping of cluster is much better in K-Medoids than K-Means. Also K-Medoids is better in terms of execution time, non sensitive to outliers and reduces noise as compared to K-Means as it minimizes the sum of dissimilarities of data objects.},

abstract = {Includes index. This is a book for enterprise architects, database administrators, and developers who need to understand the latest developments in database technologies. It is the book to help you choose the correct database technology at a time when concepts such as Big Data, NoSQL and NewSQL are making what used to be an easy choice into a complex decision with significant implications. The relational database (RDBMS) model completely dominated database technology for over 20 years. Today this "one size fits all" stability has been disrupted by a relatively recent explosion of new database technologies. These paradigm-busting technologies are powering the "Big Data" and "NoSQL" revolutions, as well as forcing fundamental changes in databases across the board. Deciding to use a relational database was once truly a no-brainer, and the various commercial relational databases competed on price, performance, reliability, and ease of use rather than on fundamental architectures. Today we are faced with choices between radically different database technologies. Choosing the right database today is a complex undertaking, with serious economic and technological consequences. Next Generation Databases demystifies today?s new database technologies. The book describes what each technology was designed to solve. It shows how each technology can be used to solve real word application and business problems. Most importantly, this book highlights the architectural differences between technologies that are the critical factors to consider when choosing a database platform for new and upcoming projects. ? Introduces the new technologies that have revolutionized the database landscape ? Describes how each technology can be used to solve specific application or business challenges ? Reviews the most popular new wave databases and how they use these new database technologies.

abstract = {Inventory management has become one of the key elements of the supply chain management and can greatly affect the performance of a business. The textile industry is no exception. Traditional approaches in decision making based on manager instincts and hunches are no longer enough in the today's increasingly competitive environment. Small to medium sized family owned textile businesses are usually prone to this way of thinking. This paper discusses some basic concepts and techniques for classifying inventory, controlling inventory levels, avoiding stock outs and increasing customer satisfaction. It also discusses the importance of forecasting demand and uses the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as an effective measure of the forecast error, which later becomes a basic driver for inventory management. It addresses the Service Level (SL) as a performance metric and emphasizes on the importance of Safety Stock (SS). Finally, it discusses the use of the Reorder Point (ROP) as an efficient indicator for triggering production replenishment and proposes a simple technique for prioritizing production orders.},

abstract = {The major concern of Islamic banking institutions is to conduct their business in accordance to the principles of shari'ah. In order to ensure that all their products and services comply with the principles, most of the Islamic banks have set up shari'ah advisory committees. The committees consist of experts in Islamic commercial law (fiqh muamalat) and are expected to perform an oversight role on shari'ah matters related to Islamic banking operations. The present article discusses the shari'ah governance framework adopted by Malaysian Islamic banks. It explains the roles and functions of three important entities namely National Shari'ah Advisory Council (NSAC), Shari'ah Committee (SC) and internal shari'ah department. The discussion is in light of the new shari'ah governance framework issued by Central Bank of Malaysia (BNM) in January 2011.},

abstract = {The period immediately subsequent to the Second World War is one of the most interesting episodes of the 20th century from the cultural point of view. It was a time of reflection for many contemporary European intellectuals, an opportunity to rethink the world, to begin again after the cataclysm of war. It was in this context that Aldo van Eyck began his career as an architect, as well as his collaboration with the short-lived, but intense, Cobra Movement, a group essential for understanding the post-war European cultural panorama and one of the last avant-gardes of the 20th century. This article explores the involvement of the Dutch architect, Aldo van Eyck, with the world of art. A multi-faceted relationship, an essential part of his discourse, which encompasses his cultural formation, his friendships, his critical thought, and his work. The involvement of the architect with Cobra would be a determinant in that correlation between architecture and the arts. It was a group with which he would share a common view of reality, a complex relationship with common lines of research, shared writings, exhibitions and works. To this is added the fundamental contribution of the transfer of constant values between architecture and the world of art, which characterised the relationship between the architect and the members of the group.},
